# Changelog

All notable changes to `mod_modernvideoplayer` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Learner activity report (per-user watch progress export)

## [1.3.4] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- Added full Moodle GPL boilerplate headers with explicit copyright and
  license markers to CSS, Mustache templates, AMD source, and AMD build files.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- Added explicit parameter validation, context validation, and
  `mod/modernvideoplayer:submitprogress` capability enforcement to
  `mod_modernvideoplayer_mark_complete`.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-05-09

### Changed
- Renamed the public source repository to `moodle-mod_modernvideoplayer` to
  match Moodle's recommended `moodle-{plugintype}_{pluginname}` convention.
- Updated README, issue templates, contribution notes, and Moodle submission
  documentation to use the new repository URL.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- Moodle 4.5 PHPUnit compatibility for next-activity resolution by removing a
  Moodle 5.2-only `cm_info` API call.
- Moodle codechecker failures in reporting, report table, upgrade, report page,
  and activity form formatting.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- End-of-video "Next activity" overlay with Replay and Continue actions.
- Configurable Continue target per activity: automatic next activity in course
  order or a manually selected course module.
- New AJAX web service `mod_modernvideoplayer_get_next_activity` to resolve the
  learner-visible next activity after completion state is refreshed.
- Completion badge in the custom player controls.
- Local release helper script `run-ci-local.ps1`.

### Changed
- Report page now uses Moodle `table_sql` for pagination, sortable columns, and
  downloadable exports instead of rendering every learner row in a Mustache
  table.
- Report KPI cards now use aggregate SQL so totals match the active filters
  without loading all rows into PHP.
- Resume behavior now treats already-completed saved positions as a replay
  prompt instead of trying to resume at the end of the video.
- Seekbar drag and click behavior now updates immediately while still respecting
  the server-validated allowed seek position.
- Declared support range is Moodle 4.5 through Moodle 5.2.

### Fixed
- Moodle completion is synced before next-activity resolution so completion-gated
  activities can become available immediately after video completion.
- Fullscreen fallback handling improved for WebKit/iOS Safari.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-23

### Changed
- **First stable release.** Promoted plugin maturity from `MATURITY_ALPHA` to
  `MATURITY_STABLE`. All features shipped in the 0.5.x–0.11.x line are now
  considered production-ready.
- Version bumped to `2026042300` / release `1.1.0`.

### Documentation
- `README.md`: replaced the thin Features block with a comprehensive
  **Features (Free / Community Edition)** section enumerating every capability
  shipped through v0.11.0 (playback & UI, captions/transcript/chapters, Focus
  Mode enforcement, integrity, progress & completion, gradebook, bookmarks,
  reporting, privacy, platform hygiene, quality bar).
- `README.md`: rewrote the Roadmap section to reflect that v0.5.0–v0.11.0 are
  complete.
- `.gitignore`: added patterns for scratch / working markdown notes
  (`plan-*.md`, `NOTES.md`, `TODO.md`, `SCRATCH.md`, `WORKING.md`, `*.draft.md`)
  while keeping published docs (README, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT,
  SECURITY, UPGRADING, LICENSE) tracked.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Behat acceptance scenarios:
  - `tests/behat/add_modernvideoplayer.feature` — creating an activity via the
    data generator and confirming it renders on the course page and view page
    (including the "No video" notification path).
  - `tests/behat/focus_mode_settings.feature` — Enforcement settings section is
    exposed, the three Focus Mode / PiP / transcript download toggles have the
    documented defaults (`0/1/1`), and a teacher can enable Focus Mode, disable
    transcript download, save, and round-trip the values.
- Plugin version bumped to `2026042018`.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Focus Mode enforcement** (`enforcefocus` instance setting + `defaultenforcefocus` admin default).
  When enabled it disables Picture-in-Picture, suppresses seek keyboard shortcuts
  (arrows, `J`/`L`, `<`/`>`, digit keys), and auto-pauses playback when the browser
  tab is hidden.
- **Picture-in-Picture toggle button** (`allowpip` instance setting, on by default,
  auto-disabled whenever Focus Mode is on). Controls button is rendered only when
  the browser supports PiP and the instance allows it.
- **Transcript download button** (`allowtranscriptdownload` instance setting,
  on by default). Rendered next to the transcript panel close button when captions
  exist; downloads a timestamped `.txt` transcript.
- 3 new DB columns via `db/upgrade.php` savepoint `2026042017`.
- PHPUnit `focus_mode_test.php` (3 tests) covering instance defaults, overrides,
  and the `modernvideoplayer_get_defaults()` admin-default fallbacks.
- New AMD logic: `enforcer.js::enforceFocus()`, `shortcuts.js` seek-key gate,
  `player.js` PiP + transcript-download wiring.

### Changed
- Total PHPUnit suite is now 42 tests / 115 assertions.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Learner bookmarks**:
  - New `modernvideoplayer_bookmarks` table (id, modernvideoplayerid, userid,
    position, label, timecreated, timemodified) provisioned via
    `db/upgrade.php` savepoint 2026042016, with FKs to `modernvideoplayer` and
    `user` plus an index on `(modernvideoplayerid, userid)`.
  - Domain service `mod_modernvideoplayer\local\bookmark_manager` enforcing
    trimmed non-empty labels, a 50 bookmarks-per-user cap, position clamping
    to `>= 0`, and scoped `delete_own()` / `delete_for_activity()` cleanup.
  - Three AJAX-enabled web services:
    `mod_modernvideoplayer_add_bookmark` (write, requires
    `mod/modernvideoplayer:submitprogress`),
    `mod_modernvideoplayer_list_bookmarks` (read, requires
    `mod/modernvideoplayer:view`) and
    `mod_modernvideoplayer_delete_bookmark` (write, same submitprogress
    capability, ownership-scoped).
  - Activity deletion (`modernvideoplayer_delete_instance`) now cascades
    through the manager so orphaned bookmarks are removed.
  - PHPUnit coverage in `tests/bookmarks_test.php` (10 tests / 22 assertions)
    across manager edge cases, WS happy paths and ownership enforcement.

### Changed
- Total plugin test suite now reports **39 tests / 100 assertions**, phpcs
  clean.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Gradebook integration** (`FEATURE_GRADE_HAS_GRADE`):
  - New `grade` column on the `modernvideoplayer` table (int, default 100)
    provisioned via `db/upgrade.php` savepoint 2026042015.
  - Grade callbacks in `lib.php`:
    `modernvideoplayer_grade_item_update`, `modernvideoplayer_grade_item_delete`,
    `modernvideoplayer_get_user_grades`, `modernvideoplayer_update_grades`.
  - Grade is derived linearly from `percentcomplete`
    (learner_grade = grademax × percentcomplete / 100).
  - Gradebook is refreshed from every heartbeat and from `reset_progress`,
    so teacher-facing grade columns stay in sync with watch progress.
  - `mod_form.php` now exposes the standard `Maximum grade` element.
- PHPUnit coverage in `tests/gradebook_test.php` exercises grade item
  creation, proportional scaling, custom grademax, gradebook writes, and
  grade-item deletion (6 tests / 13 assertions).
- Total plugin suite now **29 tests / 78 assertions**.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **PHPUnit coverage for custom completion rules**:
  `tests/completion/custom_completion_test.php` exercises every rule returned
  by `\mod_modernvideoplayer\completion\custom_completion::get_defined_custom_rules()`:
  - `completionvideopercent` complete/incomplete against `requiredpercent`.
  - `completionvideoend` complete/incomplete with `graceseconds` tolerance.
  - Incomplete result when no `modernvideoplayer_progress` row exists.
  - Incomplete result when `duration` is unknown (0).
  - Rule descriptions follow `cm_info->customdata.customcompletionrules`.
  - Sort order places `completionview` first.
- Total plugin suite now **23 tests / 65 assertions** (privacy + external + completion).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **External web service PHPUnit coverage**: `tests/external/external_test.php`
  covers all four WS endpoints (`get_progress`, `heartbeat`, `mark_complete`,
  `reset_progress`) end-to-end, including return-structure validation via
  `external_api::clean_returnvalue()` and course-access enforcement.
- Plugin now ships with **14 PHPUnit tests / 50 assertions** spanning
  privacy provider and external web services. The existing
  `.github/workflows/moodle-ci.yml` runs these on every push/PR via
  `moodle-plugin-ci phpunit --fail-on-warning`.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- `view.php` now emits the player config as a `<script type="application/json">`
  blob read by the AMD module instead of passing it through
  `js_call_amd()`, which triggered a `Too much data passed as arguments`
  E_USER_NOTICE in Moodle 5.0 when the strings bundle exceeded 1024 chars.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Captions (WebVTT)**: upload multiple `.vtt` files per activity. Language
  is auto-detected from filename suffix (e.g. `lecture.en.vtt`, `lecture.fr.vtt`,
  `lecture.es-MX.vtt`); unrecognised files fall back to the configured
  **Default caption language** (per-activity, with site-wide default).
- **CC button** in the player controls cycles through available caption tracks
  (off → each track → off).
- **Transcript panel**: the default-language caption track is rendered as a
  clickable cue list below the player. Clicking a cue seeks the video to that
  point; the active cue is highlighted and scrolled into view as playback
  progresses.
- New admin setting `modernvideoplayer/defaultcaptionlang` (BCP-47, default `en`).
- Captions files are included in activity backup / restore.
- **Chapter markers (WebVTT)**: upload a single `.vtt` chapter file per
  activity. Chapter starts are rendered as clickable pins on the progress bar
  and as an entry list in a chapter panel. The active chapter is highlighted
  as playback progresses; clicking a pin or chapter entry seeks the video.
- **Chapters button** in the player controls opens the chapter list panel.
- Chapter files are included in activity backup / restore.
- **Playback speed menu**: learner-facing 0.5x-2x dropdown that honors the
  per-instance speed cap and `allowplaybackspeed` flag. Filtered entries
  above the cap are hidden; the enforcer still clamps programmatic changes.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Space/K (play-pause), J/L and arrow keys (seek 10s,
  volume), M (mute), F (fullscreen), C (captions), 0-9 (seek to percent),
  `<` / `>` (speed down/up), `?` (show shortcuts help modal). Seek shortcuts
  still respect the server-side `allowedposition`.
- New shortcuts help modal listing all bindings.
- **Privacy provider**: GDPR-compliant `\mod_modernvideoplayer\privacy\provider`
  advertises all learner data (progress + watched segments), exports, and
  deletes per-user/per-context/per-userlist. Backed by PHPUnit coverage.
- **PHPUnit data generator**: `mod_modernvideoplayer_generator::create_instance()`
  with sensible defaults so other tests can spin up activity instances.
